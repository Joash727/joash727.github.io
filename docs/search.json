I specifically chose the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator because it provides a reliable measure of momentum and trend direction, which is essential for identifying high-probability entry points in a stock like AAPL. By analyzing the relationship between two moving averages of prices, the MACD allowed the system to filter out market noise and focus on genuine trend reversals.\nIntegrating an interactive data table was a strategic choice to satisfy the requirement for sharing quantitative data in a structured format. While the chart provides a high-level visual summary, the data table allows for a granular inspection of the raw numerical values, such as the exact opening and closing prices that form each candlestick. This dual-layer approach ensures that the visualization is not purely artistic but serves as a functional tool for data-driven storytelling, allowing users to verify the trends seen in the graph against the actual underlying figures."

    "text": "What is the GenAI tool you have used? Why did you choose it?\nI used Gemini to assist me with this lab because of its ability to process screenshots of my RStudio environment and provide real-time troubleshooting for Quarto website configuration.\n\n\n\nHow did the GenAI tool help you in completing the assessment?\nThe tool helped me polish up my writing and also helped me to troubleshoot errors.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think are beneficial about the tool?\nIt is extremely beneficial for debugging syntax errors in YAML and Markdown that are easy to miss manually. It allowed me to focus on the content while it handled the repetitive formatting tasks.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think are challenging about the tool?\nThe main challenge was ensuring the AI understood my specific file paths and naming conventions; I had to be very precise about naming my files (like Data Visualization.qmd) to get the right advice.\n\n\n\nHow do you think GenAI tools will assist you for your future study or work?\nIn the future, I see these tools as essential for rapid prototyping and learning new coding frameworks. They can help bridge the gap between having a technical idea and presenting it professionally on a digital platform."

One of the most persistent issues involved managing API rate limits on platforms like Binance and Crypto.com, where frequent data requests often triggered temporary IP bans and forced the development of more efficient polling intervals. Beyond connectivity, the project faced significant execution latency challenges, as the narrow profit margins in arbitrage often vanished in milliseconds before a trade could be finalized. Furthermore, calculating true profitability proved difficult because the algorithm had to be constantly refined to account for hidden costs such as exchange trading fees, withdrawal taxes, and market slippage. These obstacles highlighted the necessity of rigorous data cleaning and naming convention mapping to ensure that identical assets were accurately tracked across different exchange environments."
