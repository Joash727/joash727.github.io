I developed a stock analysis dashboard to monitor market volatility, specifically focusing on the analysis of AAPL stock performance. I created this dashboard to identify market momentum; I wanted to create a tool that could visually signal high-probability trading windows by processing complex price data in real-time. My rationale for this specific layout is to use a candlestick chart with a MACD indicator which indicates good entry points.

### Quantitative Market Data

To support the visual analysis, the table below provides a granular view of the raw numerical values processed by the dashboard during a specific trading window. This data allows for a detailed audit of the signals seen in the visual chart.

| Timestamp (SGT) | Asset | Close Price | MACD Value | Signal Line |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-10-11 03:55 | AAPL | $245.28 | 1.25 | 1.10 |
| 2025-10-11 03:56 | AAPL | $245.40 | 1.30 | 1.15 |
| 2025-10-11 03:57 | AAPL | $245.15 | 1.28 | 1.18 |
| 2025-10-11 03:58 | AAPL | $245.50 | 1.35 | 1.22 |
| 2025-10-11 03:59 | AAPL | $245.28 | 1.32 | 1.25 |



### Technical Challenges and Rationale

Developing this stock analysis dashboard presented several technical hurdles, particularly in managing high-frequency data streams to ensure the MACD and candlestick layers remained synchronized during periods of high volatility. I specifically chose the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator because it provides a reliable measure of momentum and trend direction, which is essential for identifying high-probability entry points in a stock like AAPL. By analyzing the relationship between two moving averages of prices, the MACD allowed the system to filter out market noise and focus on genuine trend reversals.

Integrating an interactive data table was a strategic choice to satisfy the requirement for sharing quantitative data in a structured format. While the chart provides a high-level visual summary, the data table allows for a granular inspection of the raw numerical values, such as the exact opening and closing prices that form each candlestick. This dual-layer approach ensures that the visualization is not purely artistic but serves as a functional tool for data-driven storytelling, allowing users to verify the trends seen in the graph against the actual underlying figures.
